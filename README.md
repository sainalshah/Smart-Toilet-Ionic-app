# Smart Toilet Ionic app
Smart Toilet was a project to help users with detecting lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and kidney failure. We partnered with a toilet company to design a custom toilet seat fitted with Near-Infrared Spectroscopy sensor. The sensor scans urine and send the data to a mobile app via Bluetooth. The processed data is then uploaded to cloud backend. The project also has a clinic User Interface, where clinic staff can use a web app to approve appointment and other functions.

The smart toilet app could initiate a NIR urine scan, analyze the result, and show the abnormality of glucose and urine pH level. The result would be uploaded to the AWS backend. The app can be used to get appointments with clinics. It also notifies user of important events.
